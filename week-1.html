• <p>In Day 2 we visited a water plant near the locality and interviewed the owner of the water plant by that we gained knowledge about the different purification method.</p>
• <p>In Day 3 we visited the same locality and we communicated with the people about the access of the water and the times of the water. After we talk with user’s we came to know that, 20% people are using tap water, with time of the water is maximum 3 hours.</p>
• <p>In Day 4 Again, we visited the same street and we continued our survey in remaining houses. We observed that some of the houses are not getting sufficient water for daily use because there are more number of the people in the house.</p>
