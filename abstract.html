      <h2>Abstract</h2>
      <p>This project studies the access to safe drinking water. Access to safe drinking water is a fundamental human right and a cornerstone of public health, social development, and economic progress. Despite global advancements, a significant portion of the world's population particularly in low-income and rural areas continues to face challenges in accessing clean and safe water. Contaminated water is a leading cause of preventable diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and diarrhoea, which disproportionately affect children and vulnerable communities. The problem is worsened by factors such as rapid urbanization, pollution, climate change, aging infrastructure, and poor water governance. Ensuring access to safe drinking water requires a comprehensive and sustainable approach. This includes the development of efficient water purification technologies, investment in infrastructure, promotion of hygiene practices, and enforcement of water quality regulations. Community education and awareness also play a crucial role in promoting responsible water usage and hygiene behaviour. International cooperation and local engagement are both essential to create lasting solutions. Achieving universal access to safe drinking water is not only critical for human health but also directly supports the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) Clean Water and Sanitation. Addressing this global challenge is vital to creating a healthier, more equitable, and sustainable world.</p>
