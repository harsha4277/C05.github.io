    <h2>Week 5: Teaching Clean Water Methods</h2>
    <p>Day 1: Students were introduced to the importance of safe drinking water through presentations highlighting water-borne diseases and daily water usage.</p>
       Day 2: A survey or video-based exploration helped students identify common sources of contaminated water, followed by a comparison chart of safe vs. unsafe water sources.</p>
        Day 3: Practical sessions demonstrated basic purification methods like boiling and filtering, where students built simple water filters using sand, gravel, and cloth.</p>
         Day 4: The focus shifted to modern methods like RO and UV filtration, with students role-playing how to maintain household water purifiers. </p>
          Day 5: Chemical purification techniques were introduced, including the safe use of chlorine and purification tablets, with water quality comparisons. </p>
          Day 6: Students created awareness materials such as posters and skits, and participated in a Water Awareness Walk to educate the community about safe drinking water practices.</p>
